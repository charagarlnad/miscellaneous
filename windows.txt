tips
overclocking/rgb programs love to cause weird problems close them if you get weird problems
boarderless windowed is basically worthless because fullscreen optimizations in w10 make regular fullscreen just as fast to tab out of AND you get the extra lil bit of performance
use w10 ltsc its ebin :)
always head to control panel -> uninstall programs -> remove windows features and remove everything because shit like 'work folders client' are just worthless and probably insecure
