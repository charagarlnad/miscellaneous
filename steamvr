a bunch of nice tips/tweaks to make vr a ton better

applying to all headsets:
go make sure your headset is in direct mode right now
wipe your configs and reinstall steamvr before you swap to a new headset
always be on the steamvr beta its unintutively more stable and in general better
disable steamvr home if you dont care for it because it can drop fps for whatever reason
disable motion smooting globally it has a performance impact and looks worse than reprojection for me
if you have multiple displays steamvr overlay fucking SUCKS so use this to beat it into using only 1 monitor https://github.com/elvissteinjr/SteamVR-PrimaryDesktopOverlay
no matter what headset/gpu you have steamvr has the supersampling too high turn off auto adjust and turn it down a touch 110% - 140% best range depending on headset/gpu
unless you are rich enough to have wireless use this to keep your cable managed https://store.steampowered.com/app/689580/TurnSignal/
when you run room setup USE ADVANCED MODE it lets you place nodes instead of just tracing its 10000x better
nearsighted gang may wanna get specialty vr presecription lenses they are nice https://vroptician.com/

vive only:
use the 6mm foam mod it gives you more fov and breathes better and is more comfy (IMO) https://vrcover.com/product/htc-vive-foam-replacement-6mm/

index only:
that pretty shiny faceplate has got to go the headset gets pretty hot and it inhibits cooling
and with the knuckles controllers try every band notch for a hour or so to find out which one fits the best your first guess will not be right
the index controllers support fast charging if you use a compatible wall wart
